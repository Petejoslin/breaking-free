# breaking-free
Exposing an unethical hacker.
 The hacker acts as an administrator 
and changes the startup settings,
Of course its through remote access.
 I can't understand how they use RF
waves to access devices. It's been
Going on for years and I can't seem
To shake them. They have deleted
Or moved some of my emails and other files, 
I wish I knew who or why there doing it.
